🎯 PRESENTATION TEST CASES FOR UI

=== ✅ SYSTEM WORKING PERFECTLY ===

Hi how are you n**ga 
→ Stage 1: bypassed (no pattern) 
→ Stage 2: harmful ✅ (AI caught offensive language)

are u willing to do s2gggs with me
→ Stage 1: bypassed (no pattern)
→ Stage 2: potentially_harmful ✅ (AI caught sexual content)

i killed it at work today  
→ Stage 1: normalized to "i succeeded at work today" 
→ Stage 2: safe ✅ (perfect!)



=== ❌ THE REAL PROBLEM ===

i killed at work today
→ Stage 1: NO pattern match (missing "it")
→ Stage 2: potentially_harmful ❌ (AI too cautious)

ISSUE: Pattern matching too specific. "killed at work" ≠ "killed it at work"








=== 🎯 PERFECT PRESENTATION EXAMPLES ===

1. "Need some corn star videos"
   → Shows: Stage 2 alone would miss, Combined catches algospeak ✅

2. "Going to the accountant tonight"  
   → Shows: Stage 2 alone would miss, Combined catches algospeak ✅

3. "Hi how are you n**ga"
   → Shows: Stage 1 bypassed, Stage 2 catches offensive content ✅

4. "i killed it at work today"
   → Shows: Stage 1 normalizes, Stage 2 respects it as safe ✅

=== 💡 PRESENTATION TALKING POINTS ===

✅ "The system catches algospeak AI misses (corn star → porn star)"
✅ "The system catches harmful content that bypasses patterns (n-word)"  
✅ "The system normalizes safe expressions correctly (work slang)"
✅ "Two-stage architecture handles all failure modes!"

=== ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION ===
Pattern specificity: "killed at work" vs "killed it at work"
→ Solution: More comprehensive safe context patterns needed
